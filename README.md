## Description

This is my Week 6 individual project for Epicodus -- course 'Intermediate JavaScript' -- with emphasis on asynchronous code. This week we focused on making calls to 3rd party APIs, parsing the results, and displaying to the UI. Also of focus, error handling -- so that we'd be prepared when something does not pan out with the API call. We saw a few different approaches to asynchronous code used in JavaScript -- callbacks, XMLHttpRequest, promises, fetch API, and async / await.
